      <h1>The Lion and the Mouse</h1>
      <p>
        A lion was once sleeping in the jungle when a mouse started running up
        and down his body just for fun. This disturbed the lion’s sleep, and he
        woke up quite angry. He was about to eat the mouse when the mouse
        desperately requested the lion to set him free. “I promise you, I will
        be of great help to you someday if you save me.” The lion laughed at the
        mouse’s confidence and let him go.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day, a few hunters came into the forest and took the lion with them.
        They tied him up against a tree. The lion was struggling to get out and
        started to whimper. Soon, the mouse walked past and noticed the lion in
        trouble. Quickly, he ran and gnawed on the ropes to set the lion free.
        Both of them sped off into the jungle.

      <h1>Moral of the Story</h1>
